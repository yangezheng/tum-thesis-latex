\section{Summary of Work}
This thesis proposed and implemented a multi-agent system that converts noisy quotation-template entries into validated, structured component specifications.  The pipeline combines language-model reasoning, tool use (API, web search, vision parsing), and rigorous validation to achieve near-human extraction accuracy while staying within a 15-second latency budget.

%--------------------------------------------------
\section{Answers to Research Questions}

\textbf{MPN extraction}: The agent achieved an accuracy of 0.97, substantially higher than the RegexOnly baseline of 0.63.

\textbf{Datasheet \& metadata retrieval}: Using a cooperative API and web approach, the system reached a field coverage rate of 0.79, compared to 0.27 for APIOnly.

\textbf{Parameter extraction}: The pipeline achieved near-human accuracy on all five key parameters, with field-level accuracy ranging from 0.79 to 0.93 and large gains over the PyPDF2 baseline.

All targets defined in Chapter~\ref{chapter:problem} were met or exceeded.

\section{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A fault-tolerant orchestration of specialised LLM agents leveraging external tools.
  \item An open-sourced evaluation corpus and metrics for quotation-template processing.
  \item Demonstration, via the cost modelling example, of how enabling downstream analytics depends on the availability of structured specifications produced by the proposed system.
\end{itemize}

%--------------------------------------------------
\section{Future Directions}
Beyond the items listed in Chapter~\ref{chapter:discussion}, two strategic avenues merit exploration:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Marking code–first architecture}: Extending the system to scan component marking codes directly and initiate extraction from these codes, enabling processing even when the MPN is not explicitly available.
  \item \textbf{Human–AI collaboration}: Designing UX workflows where engineers can correct or confirm extractions with minimal friction.
\end{itemize}

\section{Closing Remarks}
By demonstrating that large-scale language and vision models can be orchestrated into a reliable, auditable pipeline, this work lays a foundation for next-generation procurement analytics.  Continued advances in multimodal LLMs and cost-efficient inference will only amplify the impact of such systems.
