\section{Summary of Work}
This thesis proposed and implemented a multi-agent system that converts noisy quotation-template entries into validated, structured component specifications.  The pipeline combines language-model reasoning, tool use (API, web search, vision parsing), and rigorous validation to achieve near-human extraction accuracy while staying within a 15-second latency budget.

\section{Answers to Research Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{RQ1—MPN extraction}: The agent attained an F1 of~0.94, outperforming regex baselines by 28~percentage points.
  \item \textbf{RQ2—Datasheet retrieval}: Cooperative API and web agents reached a Recall@3 of~0.93, ensuring broad coverage across suppliers.
  \item \textbf{RQ3—Parameter alignment}: Vision-based parsing, combined with cross-source validation, delivered a field-level F1 of~0.90.
\end{enumerate}
All targets defined in Chapter~\ref{chapter:problem} were met or exceeded.

\section{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A fault-tolerant orchestration of specialised LLM agents leveraging external tools.
  \item An open-sourced evaluation corpus and metrics for quotation-template processing.
  \item Empirical evidence that structured specs improve downstream cost modelling (57\,\% MAE reduction).
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Directions}
Beyond the items listed in Chapter~\ref{chapter:discussion}, two strategic avenues merit exploration:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Cross-domain generalisation}: Adapting the architecture to mechanical BOMs and service quotations.
  \item \textbf{Human–AI collaboration}: Designing UX workflows where engineers can correct or confirm extractions with minimal friction.
\end{itemize}

\section{Closing Remarks}
By demonstrating that large-scale language and vision models can be orchestrated into a reliable, auditable pipeline, this work lays a foundation for next-generation procurement analytics.  Continued advances in multimodal LLMs and cost-efficient inference will only amplify the impact of such systems.
