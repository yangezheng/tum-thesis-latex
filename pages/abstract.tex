In industrial procurement, cost engineers often work with \textbf{Material Pricing Sheets} provided by suppliers—semi-structured documents containing identifiers, component descriptions, and technical specifications. While Manufacturer Part Numbers (MPNs) are typically present, they are often embedded in noisy text alongside other attributes, making reliable extraction and interpretation difficult. Automating the full pipeline—from Material Pricing Sheet to datasheet to validated component specifications—requires coordinating diverse tools: language models, web search, document parsing, and schema validation. Rigid scripts and monolithic workflows tend to break in the face of data variation or missing fields. This thesis addresses that gap by designing a \textbf{modular multi-agent system} where each agent specializes in one task (e.g., MPN extraction, datasheet retrieval, VLM parsing), enabling flexible, fault-tolerant, and interpretable orchestration across real-world data acquisition scenarios.
