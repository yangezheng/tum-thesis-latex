In industrial procurement, engineers often work with \textbf{Quotation Analysis Forms (QAFs)} provided by suppliers—semi-structured documents containing part descriptions, electrical specifications, and inconsistent identifiers. While Manufacturer Part Numbers (MPNs) are typically present, they are often embedded in noisy text alongside other attributes, making reliable extraction and interpretation difficult. Automating the full pipeline—from QAF to datasheet to validated component specifications—requires coordinating diverse tools: language models, web search, document parsing, and schema validation. Rigid scripts and monolithic workflows tend to break in the face of data variation or missing fields. This thesis addresses that gap by designing a \textbf{modular multi-agent system} where each agent specializes in one task (e.g., MPN extraction, datasheet retrieval, VLM parsing), enabling flexible, fault-tolerant, and interpretable orchestration across real-world data acquisition scenarios.
